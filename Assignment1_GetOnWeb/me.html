    <h1>Noam B.</h1>

    <p>
        Hello! I'm Noam. I decided to take this class because I lack experience in web development and I feel my career would benefit from gaining such experience.
        I've worked in AI & ML research for the past 3.5 years. 
        Much of my work involves developing backend algorithms, however, creating and deploying high quality UIs and APIs is critically important for facilitating user interaction with these systems.
        I'm excited to develop my web programming skills in this class.
