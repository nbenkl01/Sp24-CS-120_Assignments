                        Meet Buster, the masterful lutist and musical maestro behind the enchanting melodies of the Troubadour Twins.
                        Buster's love affair with music began at a young age when he first laid eyes on the intricate curves of a lute. 
                        From that moment on, his destiny was set: to serenade the world with his soul-stirring tunes.

                        With fingers as nimble as a rogue's and a heart as vast as the sea, Buster's performances are a testament to his unwavering passion for his craft. 
                        Whether he's strumming the strings of his lute with gentle precision or unleashing a flurry of notes in a whirlwind of sound, Buster's music transports
                        listeners to realms of wonder and whimsy.

                        But Buster's talents extend far beyond mere musical mastery. He's a storyteller at heart, weaving tales of heroism, romance, and adventure with each pluck of his strings.
                        His infectious energy and boundless enthusiasm light up every stage he graces, leaving audiences spellbound and craving for more.

                        Offstage, Buster is a jovial soul with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. When he's not captivating audiences with his performances, you can find him exploring the hidden 
                        nooks and crannies of Waterdeep, seeking inspiration in every shadowy alley and bustling marketplace.

                        Join Buster on his musical journey and let the enchanting melodies of his lute sweep you away on a magical adventure you'll never forget.
                        The world is our stage, and the music never stops.

                        infectious enthusiasm and boundless creativity infuse every performance with a sense of wonder and joy, leaving audiences spellbound and eager for more.

                        Offstage, Charlie is a free spirit with a zest for life and a love of exploration. When he's not dazzling crowds with his performances, you can find him roaming the streets of 
                        Waterdeep, seeking out new adventures and embracing every opportunity to experience the wonders of the world around him.

                        Join Charlie and let the magic of his music and movement transport you to realms of excitement and delight.

                        Meet Cluck, the feathered manager extraordinaire of the Troubadour Twins! Hatched by the twins in their Waterdeep home, Cluck may not be a great singer, but he more than makes up for it with his sharp business acumen.

                        As the trusted manager of the troupe, Cluck ensures that every aspect of the Troubadour Twins' performances runs like a well-oiled machine. 
                        From booking gigs and managing finances to organizing rehearsals and coordinating travel arrangements, Cluck handles it all with poise and professionalism.

                        Despite his lack of hands, Cluck is a master multitasker, effortlessly juggling the myriad responsibilities that come with running a successful musical ensemble. 
                        His keen eye for detail and unwavering dedication to the troupe's success make him an indispensable member of the Troubadour Twins family.

                        However, Cluck's talents extend far beyond the realm of management. With a keen ear for music and a natural sense of rhythm, he's been known to lend his vocals to the 
                        occasional chorus, adding a touch of whimsy to the troupe's performances.

                        Offstage, Cluck enjoys pecking in the finer patches of dirt around Waterdeep and soaking in the sights and sounds of the city he calls home. 
                        When he's not busy managing the troupe, you can often find him perched atop a nearby roof, basking in the warmth of the sun and dreaming up new ways to take
                        the Troubadour Twins to even greater heights.
